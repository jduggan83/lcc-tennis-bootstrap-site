      <div class="item-content">
         Entry is now open for the LCC Club Championships 2018. The Club Championships is an annual event which runs every year for all LCC members to compete for the prestigious Men's and Ladies' Singles, Doubles and Mixed Doubles perpetual trophies. Additional events coincide so players of all levels can have great games with the chance of taking home a prize.
		The tournament this year will run from the 27th August to the 8th September. No games will be played on Sunday 2nd September to accommodate those playing senior league. All finals will be on Saturday 8th September followed by our annual club dinner. The evening is always a big favourite as we get to enjoy the prize-giving, nice food and lots of fun which usually continues on into the small hours.

      <div class="item-header">How The Handicap Events Work</div>
      <div class="item-content">
		The handicap events are a great way of ensuring all players at all levels get the maximum enjoyment out of the club championships. These events are designed to handicap the stronger players to even out matches. On entry each  player/partnership will be assigned a handicap. This is an amount of free points the player/partnership can use in each set of their match. These points can be used one at a time or in bunches, at any point in the set except on match point. Volunteers from the committee will be at the club each night organising the matches and will be available if any questions regarding this format arise.
	<h4>The Rules</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Each player / team will be awarded a certain amount of points per Set. (Eg 9points)</li>
		<li>These are free points which may be used at any stage (except Match Point.)</li>
		<li>These points may used singly or in bundles together.</li>
		<li>At the beginning of the match the difference between the points of each player / team is the amount of FREE points awarded per SET.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Player A has 9 points. Player B has 6 points. Player A would be given 3 free points to be used in the each Set</li>
		<li>Team A has 2 points. Team B has 11 points. Team B would have 9 free points to be used at any stage throughout each Set.</li>
		<li>Score example if 9 free points. Team A is 30 / 15 up and leads 3 / 2 in games. Team B uses 3 free points to take the Game. Score is Now 3 games each. Team B has 6 free points left for that Set.</li>
		<li>Note: Free points DO NOT transfer into the following Set.</li>
	</ul>

      <div class="item-header">Quiz Night - Friday 7th September</div>
      <div class="item-content">
		The fun of the finals weekend will start on the Friday night. Dave Kent will be running a quiz at the bar. Expect a few questions on Man Utd no doubt. With the championships set to be at the nervy semi-finals stage, why not come down to see the tennis, and take part in the quiz. 4 people per team but we won't be too strict. This will all be followed by another weekly installment of the "Find The Joker" draw. Who knows how much the jackpot will be up to by that stage!!

      <div class="item-content">
		Play on the finals day will begin at 2:30pm. We encourage everybody in the club to come down to support all the players involved. Tea, coffee and cakes will be served during this time for all our hungry spectators. The annual club dinner will be served in the function room after 8pm, followed by the prize giving. This is always a great night in LCC, where the winners get to gloat, and the rest of us think of what might have been and begin to scheme for next year. Tickets for the meal are &euro;15. We will be in contact again closer to the time to get an idea how many people will be going to the dinner.
